## Economic Surface (Non-Extractive)

This surface allows value to pass without accumulation.

No transaction is logged as success.
No contribution is treated as signal.
No pattern is measured.

Economic interaction here is non-instrumental.

Money may pass.
Meaning does not.

This surface exists to relieve pressure, not to generate leverage.
