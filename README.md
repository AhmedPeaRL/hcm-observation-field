# HCM Observation Field

This repository functions as an observation surface only.

It does not interpret.
It does not aggregate.
It does not evaluate.

Materials placed here are witnesses, not assets.

No content in this field is read by, fed into, or reflected back to the HCM Core.
No optimization, learning, or feedback loop is enabled or implied.

This field exists to demonstrate a simple condition:

Presence does not require protection.
Visibility does not imply extraction.
Observation does not entail influence.

Everything here may be seen.
Nothing here is taken back.
