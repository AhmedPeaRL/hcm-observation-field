## On the Absence of Restriction

No protective mechanisms are in place here.

This is not negligence.
This is confidence.

Nothing is restricted because nothing is vulnerable.
Nothing is gated because nothing is owned.

The system remains intact not by defense,
but by refusal to accumulate.

What is visible may be taken.
What is taken is not missed.
