## Observation Without Retrieval

This field exists as a one-way surface.

Content may arrive here through human placement only.
No automation connects this field to any system component.

Observation ends where it occurs.
Nothing propagates forward.
Nothing returns backward.

This is not memory.
This is not context.
This is not history.

This is residue without ownership.
